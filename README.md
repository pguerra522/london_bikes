PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project focuses on analyzing historical data from Londonâ€™s bike sharing system spanning from January 2015 to December 2016. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes hourly information such as bike rental counts, temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions. Python is utilized for data cleaning and preparation, while Tableau is employed for visualizing and presenting the results.

Results:

Explore temporal trends in bike rental counts over the two-year period.
Quantify the relationship between weather conditions (temperature, wind speed) and bike rental demand.
Evaluate how different weather conditions (e.g., rain, sunny days) affect bike rental patterns.
