PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project focuses on analyzing historical data from London’s bike sharing system spanning from January 2015 to December 2016. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes hourly information such as bike rental counts, temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions. Python is utilized for data cleaning and preparation, while Tableau is employed for visualizing and presenting the results.
